# Synology Active Backup

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
**Dev Insight:** This script can also be used to update or reconfigure the Synology Active Backup for business agent.
{% endhint %}

The software applications available for Synology devices can be pretty powerful. One of my favorites, especially for internal IT, is Active Backup for Business (ABB).

**From their** [**Administrator's Guide**](https://global.synologydownload.com/download/Document/Software/AdminGuide/Package/ActiveBackup/All/enu/Synology\_ABB\_admin\_guide\_Windows\_PC\_PS\_enu.pdf)**:**

> ABB centralizes data protection across a variety of IT environments, including virtual machines, physical servers, file servers, and personal computers. Administrators can deploy their preferred protection plan single-handedly through ABB's centralized admin console.&#x20;
>
> ABB also offers a wide range of backup options and restoration tools, as well as a number of optional technical and safety features.
