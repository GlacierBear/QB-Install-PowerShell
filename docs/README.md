# Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
**Disclaimer:** While scripts in this library are designed to be RMM agnostic, they are only tested locally and from my current RMM platform.
{% endhint %}

This library is a repository of PowerShell scripts designed for use by my fellow **IT Managed Service Providers** (MSPs), primarily geared towards smaller MSPs (including one-person shops). Internal IT teams may also find the scripts useful.

**Each script page includes:**

* An overview of the script.
* Prerequisites to running the script.
* Examples for executing the script.
* Documentation for all script parameters.

**Notes:**

PowerShell scripts included in this library are built for and tested against **Windows 10 or later**, which includes **PowerShell 5.1**. Earlier versions of Windows / PowerShell will be missing cmdlets or cmdlet parameters that were introduced in later versions.

Scripts shared with :heart: by **Aaron J. Stevenson**.
